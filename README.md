### Exploratory Data Analysis

Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

1. Stars: the dataset contains data about stars including parameters such as temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star color, star type represented by numbers, and spectral class;
2. Credit Risk (in progress...): the dataset contains data about persons who take a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. I test hypotheses about the relationship of attributes and the impact on credit risk;
3. А comprehensive project exploring addiction between energy balance and greenhouse gases emissions in Catalonia, using forecasting models to evaluate the feasibility of government climate targets, statistically confirming the dependence between renewable energy production and emission reduction and identifying a balanced solution: a 10% reduction in consumption combined with a 52% increase in renewable energy production instead of initially 104%, making the 32% greenhouse gases reduction target more attainable.
